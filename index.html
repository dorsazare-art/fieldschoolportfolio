														 <br>
														 <br>
														
														 Intention: This is a Personal Project that I worked on since I am passionate about creating 3D environments.
														 <br> Process: 
														 The Blender software was used to create this 3D Living Room. The modelling approach is described briefly here. I began with the main geometry and then individually adjusted the shapes in edit mode. I chose blue and yellow as the main colours for this living room, which is different from the tutorial. I changed the texture of the objects, particularly the curatins, to make them more transparent, and I increased the metallic level of the light fixture. Two area lights were then installed to brighten the space and background. The camera was then adjusted and rendered from various angles.

															  Title: Bedroom  <br>

															  Medium: Digital Art - Blender

															  <br>
															 
															  Intention: This is a Personal Project that I worked on in order to create another type of 3D room with a different theme.
															  <br> Process: 
															  This 3D bedroom was created using Blender. I started with the walls and the floor, then added each piece of furniture and item individually and tweaked the shapes in edit mode. I also changed the colours and textures. For this bedroom, I chose green as the base colour and added wood to the furniture and yellow to the objects to make the room look warmer and cozier. Finally, I adjusted the lights and camera and rendered the model. <br>

                                                         Date of completion: 2023 <br>

														 <br>
														
														 Intention: This was a personal project that I worked on since I love making imaginative 3D environments.
														 <br> Process: 
														 Blender software was used to build this model. I started with the mushrooms and small objects around it, then added the bottle. I changed the material of the bottle to make it look like glass and eliminated some of the light reflections. I added stars and light circles to the background to make it more interesting. The blurry light circles effect was created by drawing little circles and positioning them very close to the camera. When the camera's focus is on the primary item, the small circles become blurry, resulting in this lens flare effect.		 <br>

														<br>
														<br>
														 Intention: This is a Personal Project that I worked on to learn more about creating 3D characters. 
														 <br> Process: 
														 This 3D fox character was produced in Blender. I started by making the fox's overall head and body, added the details, such as the tail, white portions, and eyes, etc., and then individually changed the colours and textures of each part. I added the bottom green circle and added a background to the character to help it stand out on a surface. I followed that by adding two area lights to either side of the character. Lastly, I adjusted the camera and rendered from several angles. <br>

								Intention and Process: This is a personal project. In this animated GIF, I attempted to illustrate a feeling of freedom in which 
								the paper airplane is flying freely like a child’s imagination
							regardless of the things happening in the world underneath. 
							The paper airplane can symbolize childhood, imagination, hopes, and dreams.
